#### Boolean Type
The Boolean type can take one of only two values, true and false. We use it to state truths and falsehoods, respectively:
```js
const isAdult = true;
const hasEnoughMoney = false;
```
#### Number Comparison
Boolean values can also be obtained as a result of comparisons, e.g., of numbers. JavaScript lets us compare them with the operators sourced straight from math lessons:
```
> — greater than
< — less than
>= — greater than or equal to
<= — less than or equal to
```
...and two more, not to be confused with the assignment = operator:
```
=== — strict equality
!== — strict inequality
```
Here's an example of their use:
```
const a = 2;

console.log(
  a === 2, // true
  a !== 2, // false
  a > 2, // false
  a < 2, // false
  a >= 2, // true
  a <= 2, // true
);
```
And another one, for good measure:
```
const age = 25;

let isAdult = age >= 18;
console.log (isAdult); // true

const isNotAdult = age < 18;
console.log (isNotAdult); // false
```
### Negation Operator (!)

To get the opposite value of a variable, we can use the logical negation operator !:
```
const age = 25;
let isAdult = age >= 18;

console.log(isAdult); // true
console.log(!isAdult); // false
```
#### Logical AND (&&)

To check whether two conditions are true simultaneously, we can use the && operator (logical AND). Its result will be true only if both conditions are true:
```
let cash = 50;
let price = 40;
let hasEnoughCash = cash >= price;

let age = 25;
let isAdult = age >= 18;

let canBuy = isAdult && hasEnoughCash; 

console.log(canBuy); // true
```
#### Logical OR (||)

To check whether at least one condition is true, we can use the || operator (logical OR). Its result will be true if at least one of the conditions is true:
```
let cash = 50;
let creditCard = 20;
let price = 40;

let hasEnoughCash = cash >= price;
let hasEnoughCredit = creditCard >= price;

let canBuy = hasEnoughCash || hasEnoughCredit; 
console.log(canBuy); // true
```
#### Useful Keyboard Shortcuts
```
F2 to rename a variable
Shift + Alt + ↑ (on Windows) or Shift + Option + ↑ (on macOS) to duplicate the line up
Shift Alt + ↓ (on Windows) orShift + Option + ↓ (on macOS) to duplicate the line down

```
